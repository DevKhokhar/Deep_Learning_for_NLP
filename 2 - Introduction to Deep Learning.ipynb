    "### Why has Deep Learning become so popular in the recent times?  \n",
    "* Deep Learning provides a very flexible, almost universal, learnable framework for representing world, visual and lingustic information.\n",
    "* Deep Learning can be used in both supervised as well as unsupervised learning scenarios. \n",
    "* Large amounts of training data favors deep learning.\n",
    "* Faster machines and multicore CPUs/GPUs favor deep learning.\n",
