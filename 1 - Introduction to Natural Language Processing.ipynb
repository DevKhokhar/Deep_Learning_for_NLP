    "### What is Natural Language Processing?    \n",
    "Natural Language Processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully proces large natural language data. This field is at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Challenges in natural-language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation. Fully understanding and representing the meaning of language (or even defining it) is a difficult goal. Perfect language understanding is AI-complete.\n",

    "Phonetics simply describes the articulatory and acoustic properties of phones (speech sounds).  Phonology studies how sounds interact as a system in a particular language.  Stated another way, phonetics studies which sounds are present in a language; phonology studies how these sounds combine and how they change in combination, as well as which sounds can contrast to produce differences in meaning (phonology describes the phones as allophones of phonemes). \n",
